	<li>Memorial Complex of Victory or Strelka</li>
	<p>The junction of Irtysh and Ulba is called Strelka (arrow). It’s where Russian settlers first started building Ust-Kamenogorsk. but there are no remnants of those early settlers. Instead, a huge WW2 monument dominates the scene, and the boulevard rounding the 2 rivers is a nice place for evening strolls and morning runs.</p>
	<li>Ethnovillage</li>
	<p>The ethnic village is a unique place in the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk. The reserve is a living monument to the peoples of Kazakhstan.
It was erected in the left-bank complex in 2010 by local history enthusiasts in just 28 days. The total area of the reserve is 10 hectares. The first visitor to this amazing place was the first President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.</p>
	<li>Eastern-Kazakhstan Regional Architecture and Ethnographic Museum Reserve</li>
	<p>The main sight in Oskemen, to use the Kazakh name for once, is the ethnographic park. This humongous, well-maintained park really has everything – it’s the top thing to do if you have some time to spend in U-K.</p>
	<li>EcoPark</li>
	<p>Ecopark (left-bank complex) in the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk is an object that is part of the natural landscape and architectural and ethnographic museum-reserve. The history of the development of the museum began in 2002, when a training complex with an area of about 6.7 hectares was transferred to it on the Left Bank. Four years later, the museum received an additional 27 hectares of land. N. Zaitsev was the director of the museum at that time.</p>
